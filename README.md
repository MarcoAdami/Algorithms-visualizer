# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A C++ program that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. Watch how different sorting algorithms reorganize arrays in real-time, represented as rectangles of varying heights.

## Features

### Implemented Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shaker Sort (Cocktail Sort)
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort

### Visualization Controls
- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Control animation speed
- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Adjust number of blocks (up to 100,000)
- Real-time visualization of block swaps
- Dedicated frames for blocks and algorithm description
- Multi-threaded algorithm execution for smooth visualization

### Performance Optimizations
- Utilizes vertex and vertexBuffer for efficient rendering
- Supports up to 100,000 blocks with minimal CPU usage
- Thread separation for algorithm execution and visualization
