Things done: 
- generalization of call sorting function 
- using different thread for the algorithm running

Things to do:
  Computationally:
  - add algorithms(quickSort, selectionSort, radixSort)
  - add time control to all the algorithm

  Visualization:
  - Adding visualization of colors of blocks compared
  - Bar to visualize the algorithm specs
  - Adding visualization of what is selected

Understand:
  - How to visualize nicely everything together
  - How to write good class function
