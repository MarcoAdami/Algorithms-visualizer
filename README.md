Things done: 

- implementation:
- generalization of call sorting function 
- using a different thread for the algorithm running
- using vertex and vertexBuffer to reduce CPU usage
- invert the window view to have the origin in let left bottom corner

Things to do:
  Computationally:
  - add algorithms(quickSort, selectionSort, radixSort)
  - add time control to all the algorithm

  Visualization:
  - Adding visualization of colors of blocks compared
  - Bar to visualize the algorithm specs
  - Adding visualization of what is selected

Understand:
  - How to visualize nicely everything together
  - How to write good class function
